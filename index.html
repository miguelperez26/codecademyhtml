        <p>There are plenty of tags we can use in HTML in order to display content differently. The most common tags are used for text.       Titles, for example can have different tags depending on the title         size, from <em><strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong></em> which is                   the largest to <em><strong>&lt;h6&gt;</strong></em> which is the           smallest.</p>
